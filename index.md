### Introduction

Hi, I'm Nick! I am from Irvine, California and will be graduating from UCSD at the end of this quarter. 

### About Me 

Some of my top **hobbies** include:

- Basketball

- Tennis

I've played and followed basketball basically my whole life, but only more recently got into tennis after going to the US Open. 

I began learning how to code in high school, but only recently have started exploring software engineering. I primarily have been doing bioinformatics research (Python, R) throughout my time at UCSD, but have pivoted into software.
